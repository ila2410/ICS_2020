# Introduction to Computational Science Course - ICS_2020

Welcome to the Introduction to the Computational Science course by School of Energy Systems! My name is IK and I will guide you through the course. 
Programming is the literacy of the XXI century. Without programming, we would not live in the world as it is now. Software is used everywhere and for various purposes, starting from clocks on your phone to control spaceships. For us, as engineers, it is a useful tool for controlling and designing mechanical systems.
